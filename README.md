A Gradle plugin for encrypting and decrypting values using Jasypt.

## Usage

The plugin is available from the
[Gradle Plugin Portal](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/org.cthing.jasypt) and can be
applied to a Gradle project using the `plugins` block:

```kotlin
plugins {
  id("org.cthing.jasypt") version "1.0.0"
}
```

### Encrypting a String

Applying the plugin creates the `encryptString` task. To encrypt a string run the
following command:
```bash
./gradlew encryptString --password=abcd --string=hello
```
The encrypted string is written to the standard output:
```
Encrypted string: 5cWMaUf/siW1z1IQPU5sbm++lUbnV0ddQbCdjkLtRDFyiw7dSsik3mqRycfOkbVv
```

### Decrypting a String

Applying the plugin creates the `decryptString` task. To decrypt a string run the
following command:
```bash
./gradlew decryptString --password=abcd --string=5cWMaUf/siW1z1IQPU5sbm++lUbnV0ddQbCdjkLtRDFyiw7dSsik3mqRycfOkbVv
```
The decrypted string is written to the standard output:
```
Decrypted string: hello
```

## Compatibility

The following Gradle and Java versions are supported:

| Plugin Version | Gradle Version | Minimum Java Version |
|----------------|----------------|----------------------|
| 1.0.0+         | 8.0+           | 17                   |
